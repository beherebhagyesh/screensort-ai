# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
-   **Theme:** Modern, minimalistic Dark Mode.
-   **Design Language:** Material Design principles, optimized for a native Android look and feel.
-   **UI Focus:** Content-first approach. Screenshots should be the primary focus, with navigation and controls remaining unobtrusive.

## User Experience (UX)
-   **Mobile-First:** The interface must be fully responsive and optimized for mobile touch interaction, given the "Add to Home Screen" goal.
-   **Simplicity:** Minimize the number of clicks required to view a specific category or screenshot.
-   **Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback for background processes (e.g., status of the OCR sorting script if possible).

## Tone & Voice
-   **Prose Style:** Concise, helpful, and direct.
-   **Terminology:** Use standard Android/Material terminology (e.g., "Fab," "App Bar," "Snackbars") for consistency.

## PWA Specifics
-   **Installability:** Ensure a high score on Lighthouse for PWA. The "Add to Home Screen" prompt should be triggered logically or remain easily accessible.
-   **Persistence:** Use theme-colored status bars to make the app feel native once installed.
